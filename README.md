# ReportingBias

This repository contains the source codes 
- to estimate temporal and regional trends in reported GLOFs, 
- to estimate GLOF trends from the predictors 'annual air temperatures' and 'research activity', and
- to hind- and forecast GLOF counts, based on these two predictors.

The codes are written in the statistical programming language R (https://www.r-project.org/) and run
using the Graphical User Interface RStudio (https://rstudio.com) from a MS Windows 10 OS. 
Please install both softwares on your machine.

The R codes depend on a number of packages. Please install those before running the codes. The comments within the scripts provide further 
details on model dependencies and usage of functions. 


## Input data

### Global_GLOF_database_2021_06_09.ods

Open-Office spreadsheet as of 09 June 2021 with seven sheets named after the regions, for which we obtained historical GLOF occurrences. 
Each sheet has 32 columns containing the attributes that we were able to collect for each GLOF. Empty cells mean 'No Data'. 
The first row is the column name, followed by two rows with further description of the content and the data structure.
The content of the columns 'Major_RGI_Region', 'Mountain_range_Region', 'Glacier',	'RGI_Glacier_Id', and	'RGI_Glacier_Area' is from the
Randolph Glacier Inventory, V6.0 (https://www.glims.org/RGI/rgi60_dl.html).


### regional_glof_stats.rds

R-Data object (a list with 8 entries) containing regional annual statistics of GLOF occurrences, temperatures, and research activity.
Description of the column names:
- 'year': Year;
- 'freq': Total number of reported GLOFs per year, including GLOFs from volcanic eruptions;
- 'moraine': Number of moraine-dam failures per year;
- 'ice': Number of ice-dam failures per year;
- 'other': Number of GLOFs from other (bedrock, water pockets, supraglacial) or unknown sources;
- 'volc': Number of GLOFs from subglacial lakes beneath ice-covered volcanoes;
- 'mb_meas': Annual number of glacier surveys measuring in-situ mass balances from the WGMS database;
- 'front_meas': Annual number of glacier surveys measuring in-situ front variations;
- 'dch_meas': Annual number of glacier surveys measuring geodetic mass balances (includes also remote sensing studies);
- 'all_meas': Annual sum of mb_meas, front_meas, and dch_meas;
- 'mb_and_front': Annual sum of mb_meas and front_meas;
- 'region': Name of the study region;
- 'year_scale': Standardised years (zero mean and unit standard deviation);
- 'temp_mean': Mean annual air temperature extracted from the CRU TS 4.05 dataset from all lakes that produced at least one GLOF in a given region;
- 'temp_q25': 25th percentile of annual air temperatures in a given region;
- 'temp_q75': 75th percentile of annual air temperatures in a given region;
- 'pre_sum': total amount of precipitation in a given region.

## Scripts

### Preprocessing.R

Script to obtain annual statistics of

- GLOF counts by dam type;
- glaciological research activity;
- temperature; and
- precipitation

from the original Open-Office spreadsheet 'Global_GLOF_database_2021_06_09.ods'
The scripts produces the R-Data object 'regional_glof_stats.rds', which is already available on this page.
