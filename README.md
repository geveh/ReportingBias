# ReportingBias

This repository contains the source codes 
- to estimate temporal and regional trends in reported GLOFs, 
- to estimate GLOF trends from the predictors 'annual air temperatures' and 'research activity', and
- to hind- and forecast GLOF counts, based on these two predictors.

The codes are written in the statistical programming language R (https://www.r-project.org/) and run
using the Graphical User Interface RStudio (https://rstudio.com) from a MS Windows 10 OS. 
Please install both softwares on your machine.
The comments within the scripts provide further details on model dependencies
and usage of functions.
